## About 
Github page made for the Monday Fantasy Football League ("Monday").

---

## Purpose
### Short Term
To announce random draft position seeding for Monday as well as a countdown timer for when it comes out. There will be a countdown timer as well as the randomized list on this page. 
### Long Term
Eventually I hope to also construct and show metrics that I make In R as a long term project, whether they be fantasy related or real life
